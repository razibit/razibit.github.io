      "A Novel Deep Learning Approach for COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-rays",
    authors: ["Rajib Dab", "Ahsan Rahman", "Saima Akter"],
    venue: "IEEE International Conference on AI in Smart Cities (ICAISC)",
    year: 2023,
    abstract:
      "This paper presents a modified ResNet architecture enhanced with attention mechanisms for COVID-19 detection from chest X-ray images. Evaluated on a dataset of 15,000 X-ray images, the model achieves 98.5% accuracy, 97.8% sensitivity, and 98.9% specificity. Grad-CAM visualizations provide explainability for clinical decision support.",

    authors: ["Rajib Dab", "Mohammad Islam"],
    venue:
      "ACM International Conference on Bangla Speech and Language Processing (ICBSLP)",
    year: 2022,
    abstract:
      "This work proposes a hybrid architecture combining a ResNet backbone with Bidirectional LSTM for handwritten Bangla text recognition. Evaluated on the BanglaWriting dataset (10,000+ samples), the model achieves 94.3% character accuracy and 87.5% word accuracy — surpassing state-of-the-art by +3.2% and +4.1% respectively.",
